#Project Overview 
Navigating the Green Book is a digital humanities project funded by the New York Public Library Labs (NYPL). It is a digitized and interactive compilation of the 1947 and 1956 volumes of _The Negro Motorist Green Book_, also known as The Green Book. On the Navigating The Green Book project site, you can be transported back to the Civil Rights Movement era. You can [view a nationwide map](https://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/map.html#layer=cluster&year=1947) or [map a trip](https://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/trip.html), in cluster or heat map view, of the 2,301 businesses where black people would be welcome at that time. 

Victor Green, a New Jersey postal worker, wrote the first volume of _The Negro Motorist Green Book_ in 1937. Throughout the mid to late 1900s, black people utilized these books as travel directories to identify where they would be welcome and safe, in light of segregation laws. Locations and businesses listed within these books included hotels, restaurants, beauty salons, nightclubs, bars, and gas stations. 

##Creators and Contributors
There was a team of experts, from various fields, that contributed to making the Navigating The Green Book Project a reality. At the bottom of the [Navigating The Green Book Project page](http://publicdomain.nypl.org/greenbook-map/) you can find a credit list of creators and contributors. 

##Intended Audience 
There are two intended audiences for this project. The first group would be Black Americans who, by way of this project, are able to learn more about their cultural history. The second audience would be the American public, as a whole, who after reviewing and interacting with the data presented in The Green Book project, will be able to better understand America’s history and the disadvantages, prejudice, and hatred Black Americans have had to endure. 


#Project Review 
##Humanistic Claims and Evidence
There are various fields in the humanities that this project can relate to and identify with, including: ethnic studies, multicultural and regional studies, geography, history, and law. 


###Area and Ethnic Studies
According to Brown University, [Area and Ethnic Studies](https://bulletin.brown.edu/the-college/concentrations/eths/) examines the, “construction of race and ethnicity in social, cultural, historical, political, and economic contexts.” 
The entirety of the Navigating The Green Book project is centered around these ideas, specifically how racism and racial segregation affected and limited Black Americans traveling in the mid 1900s. 

Further, one could examine how economies were affected at this time, using The Green Book’s data, as Black Americans could only buy, dine, and visit a limited number of businesses. Without this project, knowledge about The Green Book itself and, concurrently, an aspect and supporting example of area and ethnic studies, would not be as known or accessible to the public. 

The project does an excellent job explaining its connection to this field of study by way of its existence and the inclusion of the [introduction from the 1949 edition of _The Negro Motorist Green Book_](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/9e004590-8df4-0132-bce5-58d385a7b928) on the homepage. This introduction is an example of a Black American’s perspective that would be reviewed by ethnic studies scholars alike. 

###Multicultural and Regional Studies
Multicultural and regional studies is another field of humanities that are intertwined within the Navigating The Green Book Project. According to [Gale](https://www.gale.com/multicultural-and-regional-studies#:~:text=Investigate%20the%20academic%20discipline%20of,different%20cultural%20and%20geographic%20backgrounds.), Multicultural and Regional Studies is a field of humanities that is, “a way of teaching and learning that incorporates the histories, texts, values, beliefs, and perspectives of people from different cultural and geographic backgrounds.” 

This project directly aligns with this field of study, as it allows people, from various cultures and backgrounds, to investigate and learn about the experiences of Black Americans in the mid 1900s. By making the information from the travel guides available to the masses and shedding light on an aspect of the experiences of Black Americans, this project significantly advanced knowledge about multicultural and regional studies.

###Geography, History, and Law
Geography, history, and law are three fields in humanities that were obviously consulted throughout the creation of the Navigating The Green Book project. The project itself is a historical geographical map, based on the segregation laws at that time. The connections between these three fields and the project are apparent within the first few minutes of review. 

[According to the Royal Geographical Society with IBG](https://www.rgs.org/geography/choose-geography/geography-at-university/), the study of Geography helps us to recognize, “the great differences in cultures, political systems, economies, landscapes and environments across the world.” While viewing the map on the project site, you are able to see how geographical location affected the cultural and political landscape in regards to the businesses that were open to Black Americans. 

The interactivity of the project sheds light on the influence of geography on the laws at that time, and what eventually became history as we know it today. For example, there were more businesses open to Black Americans in the North than in the South. Which is evident after viewing the Navigating the Green Book project map. 

History and law obviously played a large part in this project. The laws of that time and the overall history of America are both put on visual display and made to be interactive by viewers. This opportunity shows the limitations of the law at that time and how history was unfair to Black Americans. Overall, this project’s inclusion of history and law  sheds light on the inconveniences Black Americans had to deal with while traveling. 


##Technology Used
The Navigating The Green Book project was created using data collected by the [NYPL Labs digitization project](https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/collections/the-green-book#/?tab=navigation). Data was extracted from the 1947 volume of The Negro Motorist Green Book using optical character recognition (OCR), to extract text and coordinate data, and the Scribe framework, to correct and make final adjustments to the information. The various volumes of The Green Book were digitized by way of this project and utilized to create the Navigating The Green Book Project. 

The entirety of the project is an interactive map. The inclusion of this map makes this project stand out from more traditional scholarship, as it makes the information more accessible and attainable. The map was exceedingly easy for me to operate and I would assume the same for other new viewers. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to view this data in such a tangible way. 


##Interesting and Problematic Issues
This project is exceedingly valuable in every aspect. It draws attention to various other humanities fields, while shedding light on the hardships faced by Black Americans in the mid 1900s. This project caught my attention, because I had never heard of _The Negro Motorist Green Book_ before. It boggles my mind that these travel guides were not only used, but necessary. Further, they were imminently useful and important, but were unfortunately not widely distributed at the time of publication. 

As I previously mentioned, the introduction from the 1949 edition of the travel guide was included on the project’s homepage. I thought this excerpt was fascinating, because the sentiments shared within it are still applicable in modern day. Although The Green Book is no longer necessary, racism is still at large in our society, but it appears in subtler ways than in the day of Victor Green. 

After exploring the website, I did not run across any links or parts that were inaccessible or broken. I do not have many critiques of this project, as I thought it was done exceptionally well. 

I do wish that there would have been more information published on the creation process. For example, the intricacies of what each contributor completed, what exact technology was used and how it worked, and their motive for embarking on this project

Additionally, I would have appreciated a more in depth description of _The Negro Motorist Green Book_. For example, I would have liked to have read testimonies of people who used the books as well as more background information on Victor Green, accessible on the project page. 

A serious drawback of the project, in its current published form, is that you can only interact with two volumes of The Green Book. There are 21 published volumes and a variety of data among these. Therefore, to be able to view more of them, would offer a fuller picture of what it was like to travel as a Black American in the mid 1900s.
